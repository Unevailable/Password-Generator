# <Password-Generator>

## Description

I was tasked to develop a webpage that generated a random password using JavaScript. The website gave users the option on how many charaters they wanted and what kind of charaters they wanted. For example it would ask if they wanted numbers in the password.

## Installation

I copied the challange code from the github repository, after that i started to work on my git bash to put it in my own repository. I used the mini project from the javascript activites to guide me on building this webpage. Furthermore i got additional help from w3schools, the Xpert learning assistant, stack overflow, and MDN web docs. after adding the needed code JavaScript code I pushed all my updates through git bash and made the site live.

## Usage

The purpose of this website is to help improve on my JavaScript skills and also to help produce strong passwords for users who use the site.
